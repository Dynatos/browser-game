Welcome to my browser game! This is a game I'm working on that utilizes a MySQL database (MariaDB) to store all game data, user profiles, and state. My goal is to host this as a live game with persistent accounts that you can log into from any browser on any platform. All calculations are done on the server side to prevent cheating. Battle is turn-based, and the status of a battle is stored so that players can stop playing at any time, and can return to finish their in-progress battle from any device.

The database stores all game data including item stats, monster values (health/damage/drop table), drop tables, random encounter tables, etc. This means that any of these values can be changed while the servers are running (doesn't effect 'in progress' battles, starting values are stored as part of in-progress battle state). This also means that new items, monsters, and areas can be added while the servers are running. You can find a set of database build commands in the gameBuildingFile folder, use buildFileWithoutTemplate to build the database's tables and populate them with all current content.
